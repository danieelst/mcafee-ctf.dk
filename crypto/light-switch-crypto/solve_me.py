	This script reads from "key" and "encrypted_flag" and uses "magic_func" to
	convert the encrypted flag into its decoded version.

	You are asked to implement the magic_func as described in CTF_1.png
	Successful decryption should print a valid flag (ATR[....]) in the console.

	This script is expected to run with python3.
